### Message
Please don't make any changes to the master branch, create your own branch and make the changes. I will pull the branches occasionally (if needed). The command for doing so using git CLT (command line tool) is:<br>
`git checkout -b branch-name`, here `checkout` is for switching branches and `-b` is for creating a new branch.
